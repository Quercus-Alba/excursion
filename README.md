# Excursion Web Page
## This is a Codecademy Off-Platform Project

### Objective of Project
In this project, students create a web page which advertises a product called “Excursion.” Students use learned skills including HTML, CSS, 
Command Line Interface (Git Bash), Git, and GitHub. The “Excursion” web page that students will build advertises a mobile app which 
helps users record and share their experiences and uses video and landscape imagery to set the scene -- a landing page is a vital tool in 
marketing a product these days, and the goal will be to entice potential customers into using the product.
